30. Scipio ; cf. p. ¹75, 26, with note—detrimentis . . . acceptis:
Caesar is always severe on Scipio, He had, he cuttingly sayS, no claim

taken in advance (prae·) the money due for the eominy year. Of. p. 29,
26-27, with note. 36. finitimis . . . relictis: sarcasm again. Scipio
might better have devoted his attention to the arch-enemy os the Ro-
mans in the East‚ than abandon his province to them in order to help
Pompey. 1. interfecerant: Int. ¹7. 2. in obsidione: see biog.
in App. Ῑ. 5. sese . . . non laturos: the gist oi the voces: cf. p. 41,

name could be discovered for osny thirty, this was deemed qood yround
for levyiny a tam on it; i.e. countless objects besides columnae and
ostia were taxed. 1¹⁷. cum imperio: sc. homines: this phrase
is subj. os praeficiebantur. There were so many ex-consuls and ex-
praetors (these only could be cum imperio) among Pompey’s followerS,
that, in order to give them all commands, some had to be put in charye
not only os ‘viiie-3, but, I had almost said (paene, cf. p. 13, 19, with
