Aemus ε Manius . . . Glabrio. A son oi! the Aemilia whom Sulla the

Dictator forced Pompey to marry while pregnant by her husband Glabrio, ¹

After the services rendered Caesar in the Civil War, iii, 15, 16, 39, 4οᾒξ 116
served him also as governor os Sicily and Achaia.

Afranius z Dacius. Had already served in Spain as legate under Pom-
pey in the Sertorian war (771), and had been made consul in CO through
Pompey’s influence and money. When Pompey in his second consulship
(55) obtained the Spanish provinces (see Int. ¹7), he sent Afranius and Pe-
treius thither to govern sor him. At the close 01 the campaign narrated in
the Civil War, i, 38-87, Afranius broke his parole and joined Pompey in

 

Greece, iii, 83, 88. After Pharsalus he fied to Africa, and after Thapsus η
116 tried to fiee to Mauritania, but was captured and killed by Caesar’s sol- ’

diers (see historical conclusion to the Notes).

Ampius 2 Τ. . . . Balbus. An ardent friend 01 Pompey, and bitter soe
of Caesar. Had been tribunus plebis in 63, praetor in 59, and governor os
Cilicia. He was banished by Caesar after the war, iii, 105, but finally par-
doned at Cicero’s request.

Antonius : Marcus. One os the ablest but -most dissipawd men Rome
ever produced. His father died while Marc was young, and his step-father,
Cornelius Lentulus, was put to death in 63 by Cicer0, as one of Catiline’s
follow-conspirator& After a corrupt boyhood and youth, he began, when
about 25 years old, to win credit as a military officer in Syria (58). Four
years aster this he won Gaesar’s favor in Gaul, and through him became
quaestor, augur, and finally tribunus plebis (50); i, 2. Caesar mentions
him quite often as an enterprising and competent officer; i, 11, 18; 111, 24,
26, 29, 30, 34, 40, 46, 65, 89. Afterward Antony’s terrible dissipation and

greed for money nearly separated the two men, but the trouble was healed, 1

and Antony remained devoted to Caesar till the latter’s death, and could

not be won over by the conspirators. Indeed he seemed to be the proper ¹

successor of Caesar, and was acting as such, when Octavianus, Caesar's
nephew and adopted son, set up claims against him. A war between them
ended in Antony’s defeat at Mutina (43). But Octavianus now deser-ted
the senate, and formed a league with Antony and his supportet· Lepidus,
known as the “second triumvirate.'’ The Roman world was divided be-

tween these three men, and the senatorial army defeated at Philippi (42). i
