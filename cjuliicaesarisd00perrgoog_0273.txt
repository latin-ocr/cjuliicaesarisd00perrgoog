other friends 01 Pompey. After the defeat at Thapsus (46) he retired to
Utica and took his own lite, rather than tall into the hands ot Caesar. The
manner of his death, ot which Plutarch gives a full account, led to his
being unduly glorified by his friends„ He was a stern martyr to his con-
victionS, although a great modern historiari calls him “the Don Qnixote of
the senatorial party,” and a ‘⁴ sool.'’

Coelius ι Μ . . . Rufus. One os the most dissipated and worthless ot
Caesar’s supportem. He had been intimate with the conspirator Catilina,
though Cicero says he had no part in the conspiracy. In 52 he was tribunus
plebis, and one os the supporters of Milo (see on p. 84, 19). He wavered
between Caesar and Pompey until he saw that Caesar was the stronger,
then joined him. The part he took in the discussion described in i, 2, marks

him from his more famous uncle 'of the same name, wh0, sor his fidelity to
Rome in the Sertorian warin Spain, received from Pompey the citizenship for
himself, his brother, and his brother's som, and who rose to great influence
at 'Rome through Pompey’s favor. The family was from Gade8,·in Spain,
where Balbus Minor was quaestor in 44-43, after serving Caesar throughout
the civil ware. Twenty years afterward he is mentioned as proconsul os
Africa, and he celebrated a triumph in 19 sor a victory there. He became
so rich that he could build a costly theatre at Rome at his own expense.
