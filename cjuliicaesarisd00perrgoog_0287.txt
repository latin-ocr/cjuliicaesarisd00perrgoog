tributa (2), and always from the plebeian order, which now vastly out-
numbered the patricians. The root of their power lay in the intercessio·
This had originally been simply the right and duty os protecting any ple·
beian against the unjust decision of. a patrician magistrate, and Sulla in his
dictatorship (13.0. 82-80), had reduced the tribunate to these ancient limits,
But when Pompey restored the office in B.C. 70, he restored all the other
powers which had gradually grown out of that early germ. From protect-
ing individuals they had assumed the duty of protecting the state as a
whole against the action of any part 01 the government; and so the jus
intercessionis had come to include the right of. vetoing any decree of the
senate, any law of the comitia, and in general any public act· os a magis-
trate, is, in the judgment of a tribune, it would be injur-ious to the people.
Their persons were sacred ; that is, no one could hindcr them in the fulfill·
ment of their duty under pain of death. The tribunes themselves, on the
other hand, had various means 01 carrying into effect their tremendous
veto-power, sometimes even sending a consul to prison. Resides, any tri-
bune could call meetings of the senate, and bring business before that body
as presidiug officer3 and in the right of assembling the comitia tributa, for
electionS‚ or sor legislatiom a tribune took precedence· of all others„
Through this assembly, which was their especial instrument, the tribunes
were able to interfere in the most important affairs of the state. For
the people were the final source of all authority3 and by inserting a
clause requiring every senator to take oath within a given period to
support the laW, all effective opposition could be stified. Thus the tri-
bunes were at times the real rulers os Rome; and the only means of quell-
ing the anarchy which such a tribune as Clodius Pulcher could raise,

was a military ruler backed by an army. The only constitutional cheek
upon the power os a tribune was the shortness of his term and the veto
of his colleagueS.

8. The Quaesteres, 20 111 number, were elected 111 the comitia tributa (2),
and had a variety of dutieS‚ all connected more or less closely with the
care of the public treasury. On the first day of office they divided their
duties by lot. Those who remained at Rome were called quaesffires
urbani. They had charge of the treasury‚ which was in the temple os
Saturn, and of the laWS‚ decrees of the senate, and other archiveS, deposited
there for safe keeping. A permanent bureau of clerkS‚ under their author-
ity, kept the accountS, received the taxeS, and in accordance with decrees
of the senate paid out money3 the consuls, when present in Rome, could
receive sunds from them even without 8 decree of. the senate. Every
general in the field was accompanied by a militam] quaestor, who acted as
paymaster of the troops, A quaestor was also connected with every pro-
vincial governor ; his duties in the province were similar to those os the
