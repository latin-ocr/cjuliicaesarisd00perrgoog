Iu preparing the notes sor this school edition os ansar's Oivil War, the
freest use has been made os all available helpS‚ especially the editions os
Doberenz and Kraner-Hofmann‚ and the commentaries of Goler.

Appendix I contains». brief biographies os the principal persons men-
tioned in the history. Appendix ΙΙ contains a condensed and connected
account os the constitution and working os the Roman government in
ansar's time, prepared specially sor this edition by Mr. Τ. D. Goodell, of
the Hartford High School, following the authority os Lange. Appendix
111 contains a brief summary os Caesar‘s military organization, in the
preparation os which Dittenberger‚ Riistow and Goler have been most ser-
viceable. These appendices are designed to make good, so far as possible
within narrow limits, a lack os the larger and expensive classical diction-
aries on the part os many students os Caesar who do not look forward to a
full course in Latin, and to serve as an outline-guide to further reading for
those who do, Appendix IV, finally, contains all important variations in
the text os the present edition from that of Nipperdey (Ed. minor, Lips„
1881).

Besides many corrections and suggestions from former colleagues in the
Hartford High School‚ and from other friendS‚ the Editor is under special
obligation to Mr. Τ. D. Goodell‚ sor cordial assistance in every part os the
work, Very valuable criticism has also been received from Professor
B. L. Gildersleeve‚ of Johns Hopkins University‚ to whom proofs of
the book have been submitted.
