APPENDIX III.

THE ORGANIZATION 013· CAESAR’S ARMY.

1. Deiectus: clo-asts, leviee. Lists were made of all Roman citizens m ι
Italy and the provinces who were liable to military duty, and recruiting
officers conducted the req‘uisite drafts 1n the several municipia, by au-
thority ot consuls or (in the provinces) proconsuls.1n the civil wars such
drasts were made without the usual authority, but according to the usual
form. Thus delectus are made sor both Caesar and Pompey in Picenum,

{-
i lgogn tolt61ie23nal defeat of Hannibal (Β. ο. 202), the Roman armies were

composed os citizens, who returned to the ways of peace as soon as the
particular campaign sor which they had been drafted was over. There
was no soldier class. But the rich rewards which the soldiers won by the
conquest of the East (B.c. 200-133), the great increase in the number of
Roman citizens aster the Social War (B.c. 90-88), and the admission to the
legions os the very poorest citizens, to whom military service was really
promotion, produced a large class who were only too glad to make war
their profession. Thus the armies 01 Caesar and Pompey were composed
to a large extent of hirelings rather than patriots.

2. Legio: reyiment (in formation), briqade (in point os size). It was
divided into 10 cohorts (cohortes = battaliom), each cohort into 3 maniples
(manipuli = companiec), and each maniple into 2 centuries (centuriae, or-
dines = plateam). Theoretically a legion numbered 600οε 2 centuries
(centum) >< 3 maniples >< 10 cohorts 3 but practically it had seldom more

. than 4000, and in Caesar’s army probably about 3600 on the average. Ι

Nora-At the battle of Pharsalus Pompey's cohorte average over 400, and caesai-'s
only 275 (iii, 88, 11-123 89, 23-24), but Pompey's were unusually full, owing to a
plentiful supply of ‘⁶ substitutes '' (iii, 4, 23-25), while Caesar's were unusually

depleted even at the beginning of the campaign iu Greece (iii, 2, 36 : 6, 218).

a. centuria, ordo t platoma century, = 50-60 men. The first word Cae-
