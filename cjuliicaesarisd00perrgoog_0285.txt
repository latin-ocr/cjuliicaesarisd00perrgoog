5. The Senatus superintended the entire administration, while the mag-
istrates were practically its ministerS. .

a. Indirectl y the senate was filled by popular election. For, under
the Sullan constitution (n. ο. 81-70) the 20 quaestore became senators at
the close ot their year oi office3 and when the censors were restored in
Β. ο. 70, and their ancient right ot revising the list os senators revived,
the censors were obliged to choose all who had held the quaestorship or
any higher office. Thus the senate contained all the statesmanship
and, all the military ability that was known to exist in the state. A
senator held his position for life, unleae removed by the consors, and that
rarely happened. The quaestore and higher magistrates attended the
meetings of the senate as members of the government, and gave their
opinion when asked, but could not vote. That is, they were not full
senatore, even though they had been before, and again became full senators
atter their year oi office3 but they had the jus sententiae dicendae.

b. The right of calling the senate together, of presiding over its ses-
sions, and of bringing business before the meeting, belonged to consuls
and tribunes, and to praetors with the consent of the consuls. Usually
nothing was said about a quorum; but at this time sessione were osten ·
thinly attended, so that Cato Uticensis was conspicuous for being always
present. At a tull meeting over 400 appeared. The magistrate who had
called the meeting presided, and had complete control of the business of
the session. He brought before the senate (referre ad senatum), in what-
ever order he chose, the subjects on which he desired advice; no one
could make a motion without his permission, and no one could give an
- opinion until called upon by him. In introducing business, the chairman
might ask advice on particular subjects (referre finite de singulis rebus),
or, in general terme, ask the senate to consider the condition of the state
· (infinite de republica referre). If he chose to allow debete, he called on
the senators tor opinions in a fixed order, naming first· those highest in
rank. But as this order depended merely on custom, it was often vio-
lated3 e. g. Caesar, during his first consulship, always called on one of the
triumvirs first. A senator could respond by making a speech, longer or
shorter (sententiam dicere), or by stating his agreement with a previous
speaker (e. g. Cn. Pompeio adsentior), or by simply taking his place near
a previous speaker, in token of agreement with him (pedibus in senten-
tiam alienam ire). A senator might stave off a vote by talking against time
until sunset (diem dicendi mora ezir-ahere„ sor after sunset a vote could
not be taken. Such “ filibustering ’' was sometimes prevented by the
senate's voting ui sententiae breviter dicerentur—as Congress sometimes
, enforces a “ five minutes rule'.” Before calling for a final division, the
chairman recapitulated the various opinions (pronuntiare sententias), fix-
