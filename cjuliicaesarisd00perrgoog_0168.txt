and were afterwards enlisted by Caesar (p. 18, 28); the 7 01 Lucretius
and Attius (p. 19, 15, 21); the 6 01 Manlius (l. 19); the 3 01 Lupus
(1. 20); 24 cohorts in all. The six cohorts still necessary to make up the
3 legions besides the veteram, are easily accounted sor by such indefi-
nite references as p. 17, 183 18, 11; 22, 23. This leaves the 22 cohorts

trom the new drafts in Italy (see above on ex novo delectu) to be used ,

specially under Domitius (p. 18, 26 ; 22, 9) had been sent to Sicily (1. 34).
Remembering the 6 legions still 111 Gaiil (see on p. 15, 11), we can esti-
mate the troops now under Caesar’s command at 172 00110118, or over
60‚000 men. Of these, 58 cohortS‚ or over 2Ο,000 111811, had been Pom-
pey’S‚ and might have been retained by energetic mensures on his
part. As matters turned out he left Brundisium with only 50 00-
horts3 the two legions given up by Caesar, whom he dared not trust,
14 cohorts which Cicero tells us he had with these at Luceria, and
the remainder collected on his way to Brundisium. 01. 1. 16. Ι1 Pom·
