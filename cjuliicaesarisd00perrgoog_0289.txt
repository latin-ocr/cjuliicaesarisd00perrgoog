public by twelve lictors, who strode betore him in single file, each carrying
on his shoulder a bundle of rods (fasces), to signify the power ot the mag-
istrate to scourge criminals, Outside the city, these fasces showed an axe
projecting from each handle, signifying the power ot the magistrate to
behead criminals. . The actual power of the consuls was much restricted
by their dependence on the senate, whose decrees it was their business to
executa. But when clothed with dictatorial power by the senatus consultum
ultimum (5, 0, end), their authority, both civil and military, was nearly
absolute.

12. After serving in the city sor a year in their civil capacitiae5 the im-
perium of consuls and praetors was-prolonged, aud they were sent out by
the senate, under the title of proconsuls and propraetors, to rule in the
various provinces. Thus the duration oi! their term became two years or
more. A propraetor wielded the same power as a proconsul, except that
the senate usually gave the more lucrative provinces to, the consuls. The
provincial governor was supreme within his territory, at once commander
of the army, chief executive, and the judge in both civil and criminal
cases. In such a position there were abundant means of gaining immense
wealth. If a war was on hand, there were citios to be plundered, and
captives to be sold as slaves 3 and always there were a thousand methods
of extortion‚ none of which was left untried. A provincial governorship
was looked upon by the aristocracy as the mine from which d'ebts were to
be paid, and further pleasures and honors to be gained. By a law of Pom-
pey’S, passed in nc. 52, and aimed especially at Caesar, an interval of. five
years was required before a consul or praetor could receive a province,
and the imperium had to be renewed by popular vote 3 but the Pompeian

· leaders themselveS, in nc. 49, violated these requirementS.

13. The Censores, previous to Sulla’s dictatorship, had enjoyed exten·
sive powers and their office was deemed the highest in dignity, although
legally not superior to the consulship. Two censors were elected every five
yearS, and for generations none were chosen but consulares. They held the
office sor eighteen monthS, and their duties may be classified under three
headS. (1) They took the censm, which was a register of the citizens with
their families and¹ the amount 01 their property, revised the lists os the
tribeS, centuries and classes, according to this census, and filled the vacancies
in the senate. (2) They exercised a general control of the financeS, subject
to the authority of the senate—something as our Secretary os the Treasury
doce. They let out the collection of the taxes for five years to the highest
bidder, and made contracts for the construction os public works, as roads,
aqueducts, and temples. (3) They had a certain oversight of the morals
01 the citizens That is, according to their own judgment os public expe-
diency, without anv special enactment, they could punish any public or
