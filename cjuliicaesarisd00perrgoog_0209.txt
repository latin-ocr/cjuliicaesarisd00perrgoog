honoribus: cf. ll. 23—24, habitis here being used like 'I'ributis theros

after rewards os a public and private nature had been bestowed on ,

certain cities. 33. pedibusque: by land, as navibus = “by sea.'’
34. Narbonem: see on p. 28, 29.—legem . . . praetore : regularly a
dictator must be declarcd by a consul, after a special decree of the
senate. See App. II, 14. Lepidus, who had been in charge of the city
since Caesar’s departure in April (see on p. 27, 15, and cf. App. II, 10),
had thought of holding the consular c o mitia himself, but as this was
unprecedented, he proposed a special law (lex Aemilia de dicta-
tore cr cando) to the popular assembly (App. ΙΙ, 2), which em-
powered him to nominate a dictator. Caesar then, as dictator, could
hold the consular comitia . Of. iii, 1. All this was shrewdly man-
aged by Caesar, to avoid the appearance os violent usurpation.

pro nomine . . . conservans: out of consideration for the fame and
aye of the city, Caesar did not utterly destroy it, nor anw it to be
plundered, but left it “to be intellectually the centre os Hellenic cul-
ture in that distant Celtic country.’' 23. ceteras: four had returned
trom Spain with the captured legions of Afranius and Petreius (see on
p. 50, 25); these, with one of the three legions left for the siege of
Massilia (p. 28, 21), now return into Italy and concentrate near Brun-
disium for the campaign in the East.
