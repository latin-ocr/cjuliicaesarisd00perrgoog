286 APPENDIX III.

13. Cohors praetoria. This was the general’s body-guard, composed ot
picked troopS‚ both cavalry and evocati. The term is sometimes made to
include those Roman youth of noble birth who accompanied a general to
learn the art os war under his command, and who were his intimate asso-
ciates (contubernales, 20). They correspond to our lower “ staff-Officers ’⁹

or “adjutanls.’' From their number came usually tribuni militum, and
praefecti equitum.

14. Pabri. A corps of engineers, smithS, carpentem, ‘⁴ sappers and
minerS‚'' under a praefectus fabrum (1, 24, 25), chief os enyineera They

built bridges, winter barrackS, siege-engines and workS, and repaired and
manuiaotured weapons and armor. They were not incorporated into the
legionS.

16. Musical Instrumenta and Signals.

Signals for falling into line, attacking or retreating, were blown by the
tubicines on the trumpet (tuba). Signals sor, the four military watches of
the night (vigiliae) were blown by bucinatores on the bucina, a curved
trumpet or “bugle ; ” 11, 36, 31. 81811015 for the cavalry were given by the
liticines upon the shrill-sounding lituus, a tuba curved at the larger end.
The chief signals were 'blown 111 iront of the general’s tent (classicum
canere). Pompe-y divides the honor with his father-in-law‚ iii, 82, 34-36.
To terrify the enemy or incite the soldiers all the instruments sounded
together, iii, 92, 32-34, 1.0. 51811015 sounded 0111110118 the lines,

implementS‚ siege-machineS, artillery‚ etc.‚ etc., were transported by pack-
animaIS, about 50 to the cohort‚ each tended by a “driver” (calo), who also
did the more menial duties of the camp. When the army set out, the first
signal was for striking the tents and packing into bundles (sarcinae, 3, 0)
the personal baggage (vasa conclamare,= conclamare ut vasa colli-
g antu r, i, 66, 303 iii, 37, 34-35). At the second signal the heavy baggage
was put upon the pack·animals, and at the third the soldiers 1011 into line
aud began the march. It was a disgraoe to a general to leave his camp
without these regular signals ; iii, 76, 9-1ος 37, 34-35. Α body of soldiers
taken collectively was said to be expeditus when unaccompanied and un-
hampered by a baggage-train (cf. 3, 0, end). An iter expeditum is a march
over good roads, without obstacleS, unhindered by the enemy.

and named from their aquilae.
