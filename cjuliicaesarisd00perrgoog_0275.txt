Pufius ε Q. . . . Calenus. Mentioned once in the Bellum Gallicum aa
Caesar’s legate. As tribunusplebis also in 61, and as praetor in 59, he had
been a merc tool in Caesar’s hands». After what is told os him in this his-
tory, i, 873 iii, 8, 14, 26, 56, he was made consul by Caesar in 4¹7, and after
Caesar's death served Antony as legate. He died in 41.

Gabinius t A.‚· iii, 4, 103. As tribuatus plebis in 66 he had proposed and
helped carry the famous law giving Pompey sole command os the war
against the pirates (see on p. 62, 35). He was consul in 58,· and then pro-
consul in Syria. During his administrat-ion of this province, supported by
Pompey, he illegally assisted the worthless Ptolemy Auletes (see on p. 123,
17) to regain his throne in Egypt. For this he was tried on his return to
Rome, and at last banished. In 49 he returned and joined Caesar’s party.
After Pharsalus Caesar sent him to assist his legate Cornificius in Illyricum,
but he was here defeated, and forced to shut himself up in Salona (see on
p. ⁹77, 25), where he died.

J uba: first·king of Numidia oi that name. ' He was strongly attached
to Pompey out oi gratitude sor savors received, and out oi hatred sor
Caesar’s pet officer Curi0, who, when tribunus plebia, had proposed to make
Numidia a Roman province. J uba’s triumph over Curio is told in ii, 23-44.
Cf. i, 6. After Pharsalus he supported the Pompeians in Africa, and aster

 

Thapsus had Petreius kill him, because refused entrance into his own · Δ

stronghold of Zama (see historical remarks at close oi N otes).

Labienus : T. Atius,· i, 15; ιιι, 13, 19, 71, 87. Had been tribunus plebia
in 63, and Caesar’s most trusted and able legate all through the Gallie cam-
pai gns (58-50)‚ but at the outbreak of the Civil War deserted his old leader
and entered the service of Pompey‚ where he displayed a most cruel and
venomous hatred toward Caesar and his old comrades-in-arms. He was
prominent in the battles of Pharsalus), Thapsus and Munda, in each of
which he was thoroughly beaten by Caesar, and in the last of which he was
killed, having himself, by a singular fatality, produced the disorder in the
Pompeian ranks which turned the desperate struggle in Caesar’s favor.

Laelius: D.,· ιιι, 5, ’7, 40, 100. The most known oi him is told in this
history.

Lentulus ε L. Cornelius . . . (Orus). Consul in 49 with Gaius Marcellus
the younger, defeating Caesar’s friend Sergius Galba. His career after the
