private immorality, or any practice which they deemed inconsistent with
the dignity of a Roman. Their mode of punishment was by degrading the

’ delinquent from his rank in the state, removing senators and equites from

their erdem, and sometimes depriving a citizen ot his vote. Sulla prac-
tically abolished the censorship3 and after it was restored in B.c. 70, under
the lead of Pompey, its dignity and power were not what they had formerly
been.

14. The Dictator, during the early republic, was nominated to the people
by one of the consuls, at the command of the senate, in times os special
danger. The office could be held no longer than six months, and generally
was laid down n'mch earlier. While· in office the dictator possessed the
sole, unrestricted power ot the early kingS. Sulla’s and Caesar’s dictator-
ships differed from each other, and both differed from the primitive one.
The ancient title was used to give a familiar appearance to a power that was
really a kind of military despotism, the beginning os the empire3 even the
old forms were not altogether observed. Thus Sulla compelled the senate
to declare an interreynum, and elect an interrex, which officer then, at his
' direction, nominated him to the people as dictator, but for an unlimited
time and with practically unlimited powers, So Caesar was nominated to ,
his first dictatorship in 49 Β.ο., not by a consul, but by a praetor expressly
authorized to do so by a special law. The magister equitum was an officer
—practieally a vice-dictator—always appointed with the dictator, in much
the same ‘manner as the dictator himself, and generally at his nomination.

15. The collegium Pontificum stood at the head of the complicated
religious machinery of the state. The president os the college, which con-
sisted os 15 memberS, was the pontifex maximum Caesar held that position
from Β. ο. 63 till his assassination. During this period the pontiffs were
practically elected by the tribes, though in a little different way from the
magistrates; they held office for lise, and within their sphere were respon-
sible to no one, not even the senate. Their extensive powers in religious
mettere, especially in regard to the calendar, gave them great influenee
politically.
