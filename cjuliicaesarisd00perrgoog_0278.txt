APPENDIX I. 267

· Pedius t Q. A nephew 01 Caesar, and one of his legates in Gaul. Caesar
raised him to the praetorship after the outbreak of the civil War, and left
him in Italy during the campaign in Greece. Here he suppressed Milo’s
insurrection3 iii, 22. He was afterward given a triumph in 45 for good
service in Spain, was one of Caesar-'s principal 110115, and was consul with
Octavianus in 42, during which year he died, just after the formation of
the “ second triumvirate '’ (see biog. 01 Antony).

Petreius: Μ. A man 01 great military experience and capacity. He
conquered Catiline in 62. His career after surrendering to Caesar in Spain
(i, 38-87 ; 01. 11, 17-18) is like that of Afranius, He too broke his parole
and joined Pompey in Greeee, fied to Africa after PharsaluS, and after
Thapsus fied with King J uba (see his biog.) to Zama. ·On being refused
admittance to the town, they took each other’s lives.

Philippus ε L. Marcius,- i, 6. Had been consul in 56. He was the sec-
ond husband or Caesar's niece, and step—'father 01 Octavianus (Augustus).
Although thus closely connected with Caesar, he seems to have remained
neutral during the civil War, without, however, forfeiting Caesar’s good-
will. He lived to see his step-son master 01 the world.

Piso ε L. Calpurnius ‚· i, 3. Father of Caesar’s fourth wife, Calpurnia,
a corrupt and wauton man. He had been consul in 58 through Cacsar’s
influence, as his colleague Gabinius (see his biog.) was through that of
Pompey. He helped banish Cicero. Although the official plundering 01
the provinces had come to be almost the privilege 01 8 consular, his extor-
tions in Macedonia were so shameless as to bring about his recall by the
senate, after he had been in office only two years 01 1110 customary five (5¹7-
56). In 50 he was censor at Caesar's request. When the Civil War broke
out he remained neutral. After ansar’s murder he became a friend of
Antony.

Pompeius: Gnaeus . . . (Filius),· iii, 4, 5, 40. The eldest son 01 Pompey
the Great, named after his father. After Pharsalus he went to Africa, then
to Spain, where Caesar defeated him and his more famous younger brother
Sextus in the bloody battle of Munda (see historical remarks at close 01
Notes). Gnaeus was captured and killed.

Quintilius z S. . . . Varus ,· i, 233 ii, 28. After these events he was par-
doned by Caesar, but fought on the side of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi,

‚ after which battle he had his freedman kin him.
