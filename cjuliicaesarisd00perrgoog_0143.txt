infinite: about the condition os the state in yeneral, so 85 to avoid mo-
tions based on Gaesar's definite propositions (re ferre de singulis
rebus finite), which would be likely to pass. Appendix II, 5, b.
5. senatui reique publicae: with non defuturum (de sum), G. 3453
Gr. 231, 8; H. 386. 6. 58; G. 5213 Gr. 196, 8; H. 449,1.—Fr0m se non
defuturum to receptum (10), we have 811 example os indirect quotation,
indirect discourse (Oratio Obliqua). Something is stated not as 8 fact,
but only 85 thought or said by some one. The Latin, in such 8 case,
changes 811 the leading sentences of the person quoted irom the indica-
tive into the infinitive, and puts 811 the subordinate sentences (and 811
commands) into the subjunctive. Remembering that indirect discourse ἱ
“ reports not the exact words spoken, but the general impression pro-
duced,'’ we may say that the original language (Oratio Recta) os Len-

tulus here reported byCaesarwas senatui reique publicae non
deero si...vultis (or volunt). When this is put in indii-eet

form by 088581, and made to depend on pollicetur, de ero in the lead-
ing sentence becomes defuturum (esse), and vultis (or volunt) in
the subordinate clause becomes velint. If Caesar had used· pollicetur
according to its sense 85 8 historica] tense, velint would have been
vellent. G. 511, R. 13 Gr. 28¹7, e; H. 495, ii.—The clause se non
defuturum serves 85 object to⁰pollicetun G. 5273 Gr. 330,1; H. 535, i.
——non deesse can be translaoed to help, by Litotes. G. 448, R. 2; Gr.
209, c; H. 637, viii. ⁸7. sin . . . respiciant atque. . . sequantur: cor-
respond to si velint above, and se . . . capturum (esse) neque . . .
obtemperaturum (esse) to se non defuturum (esse), though the in-
finitives now depend on an idea of threateniny to be supplied from
pollicetur.—respiciant, sequentur: have reqard for, aim to secure.
8. ut . . . fecerint: as they had done. If pollicetur were used 85 8
historica] tense, fecerint would be fecissent. cf. si . . . velint
above—sibi consilium capturum (esse) would take mea-sures for his
own safety, look out for his oum intensis—neque: aad not. G. 4823
Gr. 156, 8; H. 310,1. 10. habere: dependent on the idea of declarinq
, implied in ponicetur.—qu0que: G. 481; Gr. 151, a3 H. 569, iii.—-re-
ceptum: 888. sing. of receptuS‚ 4²¹· decl.; habere receptum ad
aliquem, to have a retreat, ie. to be able to retreat to any one. Cf.
B. Gr. vi, 9, 118 ad eos Ambiorix receptum haberet. Len-
tulus threatens to ally himself with Caesar against the senate, it he
cannot bring the senate to hostile messuros against Caesar.
