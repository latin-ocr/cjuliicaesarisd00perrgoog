bunician authority had arisen out of the right to annul the official acts
of the magistrates by vete, and, eventus-ily, to fine any one who should
oppose that right and take steps for his farther punishment; this was
still left to the tribunes, excepting that a heavy fine, destroying as a
rule a man’s civil existence, was imposed on the abuse of the right of
intercession.” 14. septimo die: i.e. of this debete, which had begun
