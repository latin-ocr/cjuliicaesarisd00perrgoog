memberS. The tribuneS, oonsuIS, and praetore could summon and preside
over this assembly‚ and only the presiding magistrate could bring business
before it. All public discussions took place in meetings (contiones), previ-
ous to the comitia proper. At the time sor voting‚ the people arranged
themselves by tribes in certain pene, marked off by cords or other barriers
(saepta). One tribe, selected by lot, voted first, each man handing his
ballot to a royato‘r, as he went through a narrow passage called pons into a
larger enclosure called ovile, or ’“ sheepfold.'' These ballots were eounted at
once and the result announced; then the other tribes voted in the same
manner and probably all at the same time, each passing through a separate

e pona The vote of the first tribe often had more influence over the succeed-

ing voters than any number of argumente. A majority os tribal votes
decided the matter.

3. In the Comitia centuriata, or assembly by classes and centuries, the
people elected the consuls, praetors‚ and censore. In each os the 35 tribeS,
the citizens who had property worth 11,000 asses (about 8220) or more,
were divided into five classeS‚ according to wealth, the richest in the first
clasS, and the poorest in the fifth. Each class in every tribe was further
divided into two companies (centuriae), one of seniores, or men above
sorty-five years oi age, the other of junior-ee, or men between seventeen and
sorty-flve. Thus every tribe contained 10 centuriae, each having one vote.
Above these 350 companies were 18 centuries of equites—that is those pos-
sessed of 400,000 sestertii (about 816, 000), or more. There were, besides,
tour centuries of workmen and musicians, and below all one century of
proletarii, or citizens having less than 11,000 asses. The number os een-
turiae, then, was properly 373; by the arrangement described above, it is
plain that wealth and mature age had more weight in the comitia centuri-
ata than in the comitia tributa. In voting, which was done in the same
way as in the comitia tributa, one of the 70 centuries of the first class was
selected by lot to vote first3 aster the announcement of this result, the other
centuries of the first class voted, together with the equites ‚· then came the
other classes in order. Further‚ with each of the four latter classeS, there
voted a century made up of those who had arrived too late to vote in their
proper classes, Thus there were in all 377 votes, a majority of which
decided. During this period it was almost always a consul who sum-
moned and presided over meetings of the comitia centuriata.

Both these assemblies were often as thinly attended as the town-meeting
in a New England city, sometimes not more than five voters appearing
sor each tribe.

4. The Comitia Curiata was the ancient assembly of patricians only3
it still survived as a mere form, but possessed no politieal power
whatever. ·
