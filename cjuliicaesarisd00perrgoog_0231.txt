Clur. XXV. Caesar blames Antony and Calenus for not crossing
sooner, and gives them positive orders to improve the first

favorable wind.

36. praecipitaverat: had beyun to ἄνατα toward a close. It was now
about April lst‚ i.e. Feb. lst by the seasons and the reformed calendar
(see on p. 78, 14), and Pompey had allowed Caesar, with only hali his

86 army, to hold him in check at the Apsus sor nearly three months, 3.
quibus . . . existimabat: to which he thought they must necessarily
intrust themselves Caesar relied searlessly 011 1115 fel icitaS‚ or
toi-tuna, which Cicero speaks of as one of the requisites in a great
general, and as possessed in a high degree by Pompey (pro lege Manilia
xvi, 46); other historians tell how, during this anxious time os waiting
ior the rest of his 101665, Caesar began to suspect that Antony was pur-
posely delaying, and 50, 011 a· stormy day, entered an open boat, pre·
tending to be a messenger of Caesar’S, and forced -the unwilling crew to
put out to sea for Italy. The sea grew so violent that the boatman
refused to proceed, and even put about, when Caesar ordered him on, at
the same time disclosin g who he waS‚ and saying, “ be not afraid, you
carry Caesar and 1115 fortune.” In spite of renewed attempta however,
the boat was actually driven back into the mouth os the Apsus 4.
Quantoque . . . tanto: frcely, the more (of) this sea-son had passed by,
the more, etc. The winter season is meant, when the winds were strong
and favorable for the sailing transporta As spring came on the winds
grew lighter, and so the season was more difficult for transporting the
troops (11. 9-10), while Pompey's ships 01 war could better remain out
at sea on guard. 7. quoniam . . . impedirent: the contents of Pom-
