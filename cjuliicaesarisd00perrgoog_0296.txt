would be the same aiter substituting nonus 101· decimus, in the 8th oo.
tavus, and so on up to the first cohort (primus hastatus posterior, ete„
· etc.).

The centurionships in the lowest cohort (perhaps those in the three rear
cohorts in the order 01 battle, see 2, d), Caesar calls infimi ordines, using ·
the word ordo not only 101 1110 century (2, a) but also 101· the offioe of cen-
turion, and even 101· 1110 centurion himself ; 1, 3, 1’7; 11, 35, 10. So the six
centurionships 01 the first cohort (possibly those 01 1110 four 110111 00110115 111
1110 order 01 battle) are primi ordines, priores ordines, and those between
these and the infimi ordines are inferiores ordines3 i, 46, 12.

b. The triarii (2, b) 11ωά to be called pilani, from the weapon (pilum)
which they alone wielded‚ and a century or ordo 01 1110111 was and continued
10 110 called pilus, a name which, like ⁴ordo (see a, above) was given to the
centurion himself.. Hence decimus pilus prior = centurio prioris ordinis
primi manipuli (triariorum) decimae cohortis. So primus pilus prior
(abbreviated to primus pilus and primipilus) = centurio prioris ordinis
primi manipuli (triariorum) primae cohortis. This was the highest cen-
turionship in the legion, a post 01 great responsibility, honor, and towards,

c. Caesar 10505 a centurion (i, 46, 11) ex primo hastato, i. e. ex manipulo
hastatorum cohortis primae, the 111111 or sixth (according as he was has-
tatus prior or posterior) centurionship in the legion, to which he had been
promoted 101· “ 1010 valor.'' Caesar promotes a centurion (iii, 63, 27) for
the greatest bravery ab octavis ordinibus (i.e. from an ordo in the 8111
0011011) ad primipilum (1.0. 10 1110 very first ordo 01 1110 whole legion). A
first cohort loses (iii, 64, 18) 011 115 centurions except the princeps prior,
ie. the centurion 01 1110 first ordo 01 1110 principes, the third in rank in the
whole legion. - -

12. Evocati. These were soldiers who had served out their 111110, and so
were legally exempt from further military duty, but who had been specially
invited (nominatim evocati) by a general to re-enter his service, and en-
oouraged to do 50 by rewardS, exemption 110111 1110 111010 menial duties 01

i, 3, 16-17.- . They ranked with the lower centurions, probably received as
much pay, and are 011011 mentioned with them as 01 special importance ;
1, 3, 20; 17, 11; 111, 53, 16. Α1 1110 battle 01 Pharsalus, whatever may have
been his practice before 11115, Caesar's evocati formed a body 01 picked
troops, detached 101· special service, and stationed at the right 01 the first
cohort 01 1110 10111 legion, at the post of honor3 iii, 91.
