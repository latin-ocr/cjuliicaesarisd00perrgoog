404; at tha? value which each of these articles had had before the war.
All values had fallen beavily in ‘consequence os the outbreak os the
war, so that a man whose propertyin good times was more than enough
to balance his ‹lebts, might find himself now unable· to pay them even
by parting with his property. Caesar's plan was an arbitrary one, it is
true, but it savored both classeS, the debtor by increasing the value of
what he could offer in payment ot his deth‚ the creditor by securing
him some payment, instead os none at all (tabulae novae). 1¹7.

law) by increasing the penalty from ten years to perpetual banishment,
but it so arranged the process os trial that it was almost impossible for
the jurors finally selected to decide the case (sententiam ferentibus) to
have heard (audientibus) the witnesses and the arguments. For the
whole panel os jurors (j udices) numbered 360, but after the case had
been argued before them three dayS, 51 from the whole number were
selected by lot to give the final decision. Some of these would nat·
urally have been absent during parts oi the testimony. The 51 ought
to have been selected to begin with. 23. illia temporibus: the time
during Pompey's sole consulship (52) when the murder of Clodius by
Milo and the consequent excitement, led to the “ proclamation of mar-
tial law ” in the city and its occupation by Pompey’s soldierS. 24.
