sar uses only three times: i, 64, 23 76, 11 (adverbially); iii, 91, 17. Instead
he generally has the second: i, 13, 16, ex primo ordine, sc. primi man-
ipuli primae cohortis 3 74, 12, primorum ordinum centuriones ;
ii, 28, 3, ordines manipulique. Hence ordinem ducerezto be a cen-
tem-iom· huno ordinem duxerat, i, 13, 20-21.

b. manipulus: oompamy, .-= loo-120 rnen. In earlier times the three
maniples of a cohort had different armor, and were called pilani , prin-
cipes, hastati; but in Caesar's army all the legionary soldiers were
armed alike, and these words denoted the centurione and (probably) the
soldiers os the first, second, and third maniples respectively. Instead of
pilani the word triarii came into use.

o. cohors ε battalion, cohow-t, = 300-360 men. When drawn up in order
os battle the three maniples of a cohort stood s'ide by side, giving a total
trent of 120 teet, and a depth of 40 feet.

was soi-med· in three lines, the first os four cohorte, the second and third of
three each. This Caesar calls acies triplex, and describes it quite fully 1n
i, 83, where five legions are placed side by side m this order.

5 cohorte in each of its two lines, cf. i, 83, 2-4, where auxiliary troops
really form a tertia acies. Caesar wins the battle of Pharsalus by skilfully
using a quarta acies (iii, 89, 93). Cohorts ranked according to their posi-
tion in the order of battle, the first standing at the frent and right (see
above fig. )‚ and containing the fiower of the legion.
