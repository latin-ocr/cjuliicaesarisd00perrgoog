1{glstrued here like those of towns. G. 412; (dr. 258, c; Η. 426,1.--Οοεέηοε
the territory of Cosa, a town in S. W. Etruria, opposite Igilium.—
colonis: tenant& 23. praemissos . . . domum: sent home (Irom

Rome) in advanoe (prae-). 25. nova officia, veterum . . . benifici-.

orum: some os these are mentioned in the next chapter. Massilia had
helped the Romans greatly during the campaigns in Gaul, and Caesar
had not lest them unrewarded. Pompey’s, favors were nearly thirty
years old. See p. 28, 7 ff. 28. antiquitus erant: had lona been
under their protection. 31. Castellis: outlying tortresses to protect
the territory os the city.

OHAP. XXXV. Gaesar’s arguments with the chief men of Massilia
produce merely a doubtful declaration os the city’s neutrality as
between him and Pompey.

33—p.28, 5. xv primos: the senate of Massilia consisted os 600
members3 fifteen of these formed a special committee, and three os
these latter were the chief executive officers os the city. 35. auctori-

28 tatem: example. 2. ex auctoritate: officially, i.e. by decree of· the
whole senate. 4. N eque . . . virium: it was neither for their
judqment nor strength to decide, etc. The dispute did not come within
their jurisdicti0n‚ and they were not powersul enough to interfere.

F'or the genitives, see on p. 17, 10. 5. habeat: subJ‘V. in an ind. ⁴.

question3 why not haberet?

'7-12. patronos: peoples and cities were wont to select certain
prominent men at Rome to repraeent their interests there. Such were
called patroni, a title which was osten a mere matter of compliment.
—civitatist i.e. Massilia.—quorum alter . . . auxerit: no mention of.
these things is made elsewhere. It is most probable that the first alter
refers to Caesar (taking up the preceding names in inverse order), oon-
sidering his great influence in southern Gaul. The conquest of the
Sallye s was perhaps made by Pompey on his wayto the Sertorian war
in Spain, in, 77. Cf. p. 27, 25.—Volcarum Arecomicorum: the Are-
comici were a part of the powerful tribe of Volcae, who dwelt
between Narbo and the Rhone. Translate therefore the first name as
an adj. The Helvii lived further north, on the west bank os the
Rhone, 8. publice: in the name of the state, i.e. by decree of the
(Roman) senate—iis: strictly we expect sibi, since the language is
that of the MassaliotS, but Caesar says iis from his own point of view

as narrator. G. 521, R. 53 H. 449‚1‚ 2). 9. Sallyas: a Greek noun ·

of the 3'‘' decl. 10. paribus . . . beneficiis: abl. abs 3 since, etc.-
