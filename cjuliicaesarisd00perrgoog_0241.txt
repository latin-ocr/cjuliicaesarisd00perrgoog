Besides the words alio excu barent, there has fallen out here a
description of Caesar’s defeating an attempted sally of Pompey’s cav-
alry from Dyrrhachium, or,- as another historian says, of his vain at-
tempt to take Dyrrhachium by surprise, and of Pompey’s then attacking
with four legions one of the besieging forte, whose garrison, though
consisting of one cohort only, held out successfully several hourS, and

· was filrlilally relieved by Sulla, whom Caesar had left in comma-nd of the
siege- es.
