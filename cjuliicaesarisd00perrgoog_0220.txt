CnAP. II. Caesar goes to Brundisium, where he finds too few ships
and a diminished army. (About the middle of December, 49.)

festival, founded, according to legend, by Tarquinius Superbus, to
celebrate the union of the Romans with the Latin league. I‘t was in
honor of Jupiter Latiaris (God of the Latine), and was celebrated an-
nually from one to four days on the Alban mount, under the lead of
the newly-elected consuls, All Latin cities sent delegatcS. By holding
this festival now, Caesar “ was making himself the supreme imperso-
nation of the laws against Pompey with his hordes of Oriental auxili-
aries, ”—00mstiisquez for the election of other officers besides the
consuls App. II, 2. 34. legiones xii: five who had served in the
Spanish campaign and before Mas'silia (see on p. 62, 23), to which were ·
possibly added the two veteran legions which Curio had left in Sicily
(p. 62, 28), the veteran legion which had been-in Sardinia (p.25, 18),
the two veteran legions which had been temporarily left at Massilia
(p. 62, 22-23), one legion from the 22 cohorts mentioned p. 19, 27,
who had been doing garrison duty in Italy, and were now no longer
tironeS‚ and the legion of tirones mentioned expressly p. 87, 35.
As recruiting had probably been going on in Italy all ‘through the
Spanish campaign, legions of new recruits may have been sent to
replace the veterans withdrawn from Sicily, Sardinia and Massilia.
The fifteen cohorts lost at Curicta (see on p. 75, 25) may have been
made up of part of the Gallie levies mentioned p. 19, 27, and of still
newer recruitS. Of course· this is all pure guess-work, since Caesar
gives no particulars. Caesar has besides, in Spain, four veteran legions
(p. 61, 28), two of which had been Varro’S. 35. tantum navium:

if they had been full the number would have been from 20,000 to
