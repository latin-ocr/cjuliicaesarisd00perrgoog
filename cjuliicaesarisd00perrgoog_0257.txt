246 CAESAR ’S CIVIL WAR.

PAO!

116 certain. Caesar nowhere mentions the city of Pharsalus from which
the battle took its name, nor the EmpeuS‚ which has been by some
supposed to be the rivus quidam. But Hirtius, Caesar’s legate and
intimate friend, the probable writer os the 81:12 book os the Bellum
Gallicum, and of the Bellum Alexandrinum, speaks os Palaepharsalus
(i.e. Old Pharsalus in distinction from a N ew Pharsalus near by) as
the place where the great battle was fought. See the remarks at the
close os the noteS.

cohorts which Caesar ought to have had now; so that either duas 111)
