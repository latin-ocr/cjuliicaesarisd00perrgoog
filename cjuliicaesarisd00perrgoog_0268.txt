BIOGRAPHIOAL,

Halm follow brief biographies of all the personages of any importance
mentioned in the Bellum Civile, arranged alphabetically according to the
name most prominently used by Caesar, or by the qens-name is he makes
no distinction.

“ A Roman citizen usually had three names, The first, or praenomen,
designated the individual [our ‘ Christian name']; the second, or nomen,
the qens or tribe ; and the. third, or coquorum, the family. Thus Publius
Cornelius Scipio was Publius of the Scipio family os the Corneliam gens,
and Gaius Julius Cacsar was Gaius of the Caesar family of the Juliwn·
gens, The praenomen was often abbreviated ε

A. = Aulus. M. = Marcus, S. = Sextus,
Ap. = Appius, M.’ = Manius. Ser. = Servius,
Ο. = Gaius, Mam. = Mamercus, Sp. = Spurius,
On, = Gnaeus, N. = Numerius. T. = Titus,
D. = Decimus, P, = Publius. Ti, = Tiberius,
L. = Lucius, Q. = Quintus,

Sometimes an aynbmen or surname was added. Thus Scipio received
the surname Africanus from his victories in Africa: Publius Cornelius
Scipio Africanus. An adopted son took (1) the rull name oi! his adoptive
father, and (2) an agnomen in -ᾶηαε formed from the name of his own
gens, Thus Octavius when adopted by Caesar became Gaius Julius Caesar
Octavianus. Afterward the title os Anguem-3 was conterred upon him,
making his full name Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus Auyustus.

Women were generally known by the name of their gens, Thus the
daughter of Julius Caesar was simply Julia; ot Tullius Cicer0‚ Tullia‚· os

· Cornelius Scipi0, Cornelia. Three daughters in any family of the Cornelian

gens would be known as Cornelia, Cornelia Secumla or Minor, and Cor-
nelia Tertia.”
