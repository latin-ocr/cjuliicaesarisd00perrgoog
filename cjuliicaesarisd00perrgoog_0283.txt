THE CONSTITUTION OF THE* LATER ROMAN REPUBLIO.

1. Cives Romani. Before the outbreak 01 1110 01111 war between Caesar
and Pompey, Rome had extended her power quite around the Mediterranean.
To save herself trouble she still left some portions os this ‘⁶ circle 01 lands’'
under the sway 01 native princeS‚ like the kings 01 Egypt, Numidia, and
Mauritania ;· 111050 play-kings were independent just so 101· 05 Rome gra-
ciously permitted them to be. The rest 01 1110 empire, except Italy, was
organized into about a dozen provinces, each under the military rule 01 0
proconsul or propraetor, sent out by the Roman Senate. The inhabitants
01 Italy 115011-01 0011150 excluding women, children, and slaves—were cives
Romani, the rulers 01 1110 Roman world. But wherever a Roman citizen
lived, 110 must go to the city, 11 110 wished 10 1010, 01 110 voted 101. No 0110
had yet thought 01 0111 simple device 01 casting the votes at any number 01
convenient placeS‚ and merely sending the result 10 1110 capital. In theory
the entire Populus Romanus met in the Campus Martius to elect their
consuls; although in fact only a small 110011011 01 1110111 0011111 possibly be
present. It was really, 111 ordinarycaseS, a city mob, to whom the sale 01
111011 votes was a chief source 01 income, that chose magistrates and made
1110 10115. Finally, the nobifity‚ consisting 01 0 few wealthy 1011111105, who
had degenerated no less than the common people, were able to keep the
offices pretty much in their own hands. The result 01 1110 Civil War was 10
0101111111 11115 corrupt and selfish aristocracy, supported by 0 degraded city
rabb1e‚ and put 111 its place Caesar, supported by 011 army drawn from the
still uncorrupted portione 01 1110 empire.

2. 01 1110 three popula12 assemblies 1110 Comitia Tribfita, or assembly by
1111105, was 01 11115 111110 by 101 1110 111051 important. In it the people acted
upon all projects 01 law proposed by the magistrateS, and elected the tri-
bunes, 00111Ιο5, (1110051015, and certain 111101101 officere. The city 115011 was
divided into four wards, 01 tribue, and a certain part 01 1110 adjoining ter-
ritory into 31 more 3 in these 35 tribes all citizens were enrolled. Each
division had a single vote, determined, 01 0011150, by a majority 01 1110 tribe
