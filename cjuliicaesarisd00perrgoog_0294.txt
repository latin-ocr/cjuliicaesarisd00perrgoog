booty which they took, or by presents received from their commander,
especially if they lived to celebrate a triumph with him.

4. Auxilia. All regular legionary soldiers must be Roman citizens and
heavy armed (milites gravis armaturae). But auxilia were hired or drafted
from the natives of provinces subject to Rome, and of the country where
war was being waged. Sometimes they were furnished by allied princes
md‘peoples gratuitously. They were light armed (milites levis arma-
turae), leit to their native methods of warfare if serving sor a short time
only, but, when accompanying a particular general for a longer time, par-
tially drilled into Roman tacticS. They were thus divided into cohortS,
distinguished from those of the regular legions (legionariae cohortes) as
cohortes auxiliariae, or 'cohortes alariae (i, 73, 313 83, 4), from the posi·-
tion formerly occupied by such troops on the wings (alae). cf. cohortes
cetratae and scutatae, i, 39, 16, cohortes colonicae, ii, 19, 20. Of the
auxilia the hired slingers (funditores) and archers (sagittarii) were most
important3 i, 83, '7 ; iii, 4, 27-28.

Legion‘s composed not of Roman citizenS, but os provinciaIS, were called
vernaculae3 ii, 20, 1.

5. EquitatuS. The cavalry of Caesar consisted entirely of auxiliary
troopS, GauIS, Spaniards and Germane, either drafted in spring for a single
campaign, or hired for constant service. The former were divided by ,
tribeS, the latter into regular military divisions ε alae, “regiments” about
300 strong, turmae, “squadrons” of uncertain number, and decuriae,
“ decades, ’² The cavalry as a body was commanded by a Roman, generally
a legatus (8); the lower divisione by praefecti equitum (10), either Romans

· or natives of the country where the cavalry was raised 3 iii, 59, 60. Caesar

imitated the Germans in distributing soot-soldiers among his cavalry; iii,
75, 203 84, 7-11. The wcapons of the regular cavalry were metal corse-
lets, leathern greaveS‚ helmet, shield, lance, and long sword. Compare the
modern German Uhlan.

6. Dux belli. In Cacsar’s time the consul never left the city during his
year of actual office, but as proconsul he received by vote of the pcople an
imperium militare, after which he assumed the general’s paludamentum,
a cloak of. scarlet eloth embroidered with gold, performed religious vows on
the capitol, received a body-guard of 12 lictorS, and left the city, in which
he could not remam, and which he could not enter again without resigning
his imperium, unless by special permission. After a victory he was hailed
imperator by his soldierS, ii, 26, 10; iii, 31, 313 71, 14. The senate de-
cided how many legions a general might have, as well as upon treatics of
peace or declarations of war (see App. II, 5, c). of course in the civil war,
as well as in Gaul to some extent, Cacsar acted independently.
