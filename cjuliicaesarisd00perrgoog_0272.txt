his own hand, out of mere jealousy and hatred——“ yon Cassius has a lean
and hungry look. ” He took his own 1116 aiter being deieated at Philippi
(42). 116 was able, but greedy and mean.

Cassius: L. . . . Lonyznus. A younger brother of the above. After
serving Caesar as told iii, 34-36, 56, he became tribunus plebi-3 in 44, and
later supported Octavianus against Antony.

Cassius ε Q. . . . Lonyinus. A man 01 avarice and cruelty. He had
been Pompey’s quaestor in Spain (54), and in 49 was tribunus plebi-s with
Antony, and a soe oi the aristocracy, i, 2. Caesar took him into Spain, and,
after the defeat of Pompey’s sorceS, left him there as governor of the fur-
ther province, ii, 19, 21. Here he was so greedy and harsh that his lise was
always in danger from insurrection. When he had been removed from his
place in 47, and tried to leave the province with his ill-gotten wealth, the
ship on which he had embarked sank, and 116 was drowned at the mouth os
the Iberus·

Cato z M. Porcius . . . Uticensis; i, 4, 30, 32. Great-grandson of Cato the
Censor, surnamed Uticensis from the place where he took his own life after
Caesar’s final victory over him. He was born in 95, but early became an
orphan. In youth he showed many of the qualities which marked his politi-
6111 career. He was slow, stubborn and unmanageable. Though far inferior
to his famous ancestor, he took him for his model in all thingS, and became
a type of ancient frugality and severity. He served creditably in the army,
but showed no military taste or genius, The one tender feature of his life
was his love sor his hals-brother Caepio, whose early death he passionately
mourned. This grief and his unhappy experiences with women, did much
to sour his nature. He sei-ved now as quaestor, and reformed many abuses
of the office, so that he won general admiration. In 63 he was elected tri·
btcnus plebis, in open hostility to Pompey. His whole political career was
now a long but vain opposition to the influence of any one particular man as
opposed to that 01 the senate. Thus he violently opposed Pom pey, Crassus
and Caesar, only to be used by all in spite of himself. He had no system
or definite aim in his opposition, and so wasted his strength. In attempts
to do away with political bribery, he more than once suffered persona] vio-
lence at the hands oi a mob. 111 54 116 obtained the office of praetor. but in
51 lost an election to the consulship, through the influence oi Caesar and
Pompey, though he had favored Pompey’s being made sole consul in 52.
During the Civil War, though siding with Pompey, he gained no credit,
being no soldier, and thinking more os the horrors oi the war, than os the
best way to stop it. After the battle of Pharsalus he went to Africa from
