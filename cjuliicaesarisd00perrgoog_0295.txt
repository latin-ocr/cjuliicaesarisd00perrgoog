inally appointed by the senate. The usual number was 3, but Caesar had
10 10 Gaul, and assigned a legion to each. They were of senatorial rank,
8011 completely subject to the general's orders, so that they would not un-
dertake anything on their own responsibility 3 ii, 17, 4-53 iii, 51, 25-33.
Π they succeeded 01 sailed, their general alone received the eredit or blame.
They commanded divisions os the army in battle, and often received for
longer or shorter periods independent commands ; 111, 34.

8. Quaestor (01. App. 11, 8). This officer, corresponding to our “quarter-
master‚” accompanied a proconsul or propraetor into his province to man-
age his flnances, and, in war, took charge 01 the military supplies, payment
of the 801111018, 8810 oi booty and prisonerS, etc. He could be used also in
the quality os legatus.

9. Tribuni militum. There were six in 08011 legion, mostly young men
ot the equestrian order, chosen by Caesar from the cohors praetoria (14)
aiter 0110 or two years’ service, more on account 01 family connections 81111
personal friendship than military capacity. They are seldom mentioned,
and only as leaders os small detachments‚ 01 88 assisting in general military
duties. Cr. ii, 20, 30.

10. Praefecti. These, like the tribuni militum, were ot the equestrian
order, appointed by Caesar, and having various subordinate commands over
the auxilia (4) and the cavalry (5); i, 21,4; ii, 42, 23 iii, 37,4; 60, 13.
Sometimes the title os praefectus was given to Romans in the civil service
of a province, to increase their authority 3 iii, 32, 20.

11. Centuriones. Order 01 rank and promotion. The officers described
in 8-11, were all ot senatorial or equestrian rank, and had never served as
private soldiers. They correspond to our ‘⁴ commissioned officerS.’' The
centurions‚ 011 the other hand, who were of far more authority and impor-
tance than the lowest of our “ non-commissioned officerS‚’' were promoted
11010 the ranks to their positionS, for effective service. They almost never
rose any higher. The sixty centurions of a legion (2) then, were appointed
and advanced by Caesar through all the successive gradeS, sor their rank
varied according as they commanded maniples os hastati, principes or
triarii (2, b) in each of the 10 cohorts, and the first or second century of
the maniple—pginceps prior, posterior3 hastatus prior, posterior. These
titles and rankings remained after the names hastati, principes aud triani
had lost their original meaning (2, b) and virtually gone out of use.

a. There were thus 6 centurionships in the 10th or lowest cohort‚ through
which a centurion must regularly pass before being promoted to the lowest
centurionship of the eth or next highest cohort. The centurions of the
lOth cohort were called, iu order of rank, decimus hastatus posterior,
dec. hast. prior-3 decimus princeps posterior, dec. princ. prior; decimus
pilus (see b) posterior, and dec. pilus prior. In the 9th cohort the names
