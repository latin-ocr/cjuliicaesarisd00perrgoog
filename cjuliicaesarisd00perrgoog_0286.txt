ing the order in which he would put them to vote; of course, it was easy
to pass over any proposal displeasing to him, and thus prevent its accept-
ance. The senate voted by dividing into two groupS, one for and one
against the proposal; and each sententia was taken up in the fixed order,
until one received a majority, and thus became a senatus consultum. After
the senate was dismissed, and not till then, the decree was written down
(perscribere) by the clerks of the presiding magistrate, while a number of
senators stood by to prevent falsification.

0. Any administrative business might come before the senate ; but its
especial sphere included religion, foreign affaire, and the state financeS.
Its direction of foreign affairs included the assignment of provinces), con-
duct of war, all diplomatic machinery—ambassadors were always senators
-and the confer-ring of titles on foreign princeS. Praetically it was the
senate that declared war and made peace, unless some provincial governor
got abead of them, and then induced the senate to ratify his unauthorized
proceedings. In financial mettere, the senate, like our Congressi, regulated
taxation, and had to make appropriatione before the magistrates could use
the public funds. The senate influenced legislation in various ways,
According to old,custom, magistrates were expected to obtain its approval
before proposing a law in the comitia tributa (2); but popular leaders

The official year of the quaestors began Dec. 53 that of the tribunes Dec.

dictator, were called mayietratue curules, because they had the right of
using on public occasions a peculiar ivory stool called sella cumali-3. This
chair of state had formerly been a symbol of royalty‚ like a modern throne,
and continued to be used by those magistrates who inherited any part of
the old kingly power. The tribunate stood by itself ; the other magistra-
cies formed a regular gradation of honors through which one must pass
if he desired the consulship, and the earliest age for holding each one was
fixed by the lex annalis. This age was twenty-seven for the quaestorship,
the thirty-seventh year for the aedileship, the fortieth for the praetorship,
and the forty-third for the consulship. As no one received any pay for
serving as magistrate, only the wealthy could aspire to political honore.
