9. The Aedilem elected in the comitia tributa (2), were four -in number,
two plebeia-n and two curule. Notwithstanding this distinction in name,
however, they were essentially equal in rank, and the-‚difference in their
duties was but slight. (1) They were the regular inspectors of the marketS,
and tribunals were erected in the sorum, from which they decided petty
cases arising in the market. (2) Their superintendence of grain (cura au-
nonae) included especially the charge of distributing among the people, at
a low price, the grain sent to the capital by provinces and foreign states,
(3) They were a board of police-, water-, street-, and fite-commissionem,
rolled into one—in Latin, curatores urbis, That is, they had an oversight
of public order, the aqueducts, the streets and squares, and of night-watch-
men to guard against fires, (4) They had the management oi the public
game3‚ especially the ‘ludi mayui. This portion oi their duties involved
important consequences 3 for the rabble delighted in the circus and gladia-
torial contestS, and each aedile vied with his fellows and predecessors in the
magnificence oi his shows, in order to win popularity and voteS. Hence
the small grant of public money sor defraying the expense, even when one
was made, was vastly exceeded, so that no one could be an aedile without
great wealth‚ or the ability to get 'deeply in debt. This, of course, kept
all but the wealthy out of the *higher offieeS.

10. The Praetores corresponded to our higher judgeS. They were eight
in number, elected in the comitia centuriata (3), and after election their
spheres of duty were assigned by lot. The praetor urbinus had jurisdic-
tion in civil cases between Roman citizens; the praetor peregrinus in civil
cases between citizens and aliens (pereyo-im), and between aliens alone; the .
other six praetors presided in the regular crimina] courtS, as our judges
preside at jury trials„ The praetor urbe-mus stood at the head of the
Roman judicial system3 and while possessing little more os actual power,
he was invested with higher dignity than the others. In the absence of
both consuls from the city, it was he who acted in their place. Each prae-
tor was attended by two lictors in the city, and by six outside the city.

11. The two Consules, elected in the comitia centuriata (3), were the
highest ordinary magistrate-«5, and the chiefs os the administration. Their
power was equal‚ and each had a vet0, which was seldom exereised, over·
the official acts of the other. The consuls took precedence of all others in
their rights of summoning the senate and the comitia centuriata ,· they·
could also legislate through the comitia tributa (2). When both consuls
were present in Rome, they usually took turns in acting as head of the
administration, each holding the power for a month, beginning with the
elder; and during his one mouth the consul was always accompanied in
