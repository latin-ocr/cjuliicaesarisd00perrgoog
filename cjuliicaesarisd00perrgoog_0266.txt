he narrowly escaped defeat and even death by drowning. But he suc· 128
ceeded at last in his attempt, and, since her older brother and rival
had fallen in the struggle, Cleopatra became queen of Egypt with a
younger brother. Ι

Then Caesar passed rapidly into Pontus and annihilated PharnaceS,
the son of the great Mithridates, who had defeated Domitius CalvinuS,
Caesar-'s legate. From thence he passed through the several provinces
back to Rome in September, 47. But Cato and Scipio had collected a
large army in Africa, in connection with the King J uba who had de-
stroyed Curio. So even before the end of the year Caesar hastens
thither, and though here he narrowly escaped Curio’s fate, at last
brought the campaign to an end by his victory at ThapsuS, April eth,
46. (See biographies of Scipi0, Cato, J uba, Petreius)

One more desperate struggle remained before Caesar was undisputed
master of the world. After celebrating his triumphe, and while pro-
moting the most helpful reforms of various kinds news came of an
insurrection in Spain, headed by Pompey's two sonS, Gnaeus and Sex-
tus», who had· gathered there all the remnants of Pompey’s soldiers and
friends. In the bloody battle of Munda, March 17th‚ 45, Caesar
wrested victory from defeat and crushed the Pompeian party again.

absolute power Caesar now labored to establish on such a firm basis,
that it could be handed down to his successor as the legitimate order
of things, a Monarchy, instead of the old Republic which had come to
an end with the battle of Pharsalus,
· He reduced the Senate to the level of a mere advisory couneil, and
the sanction of the popular assemblies to a mere matter of form ; he
“ busied himself with countless reforms—reforms in the army, in finance‚
in the government of the provinceS, in the judiciam, and even in the
religious system and ,the calendar3 he projected many vast plans—
plans to fix the imperial frontier‚ to take final vcngeance on the Parthi·
anS, to remodel and adorn Rome in a style worthy of the world's ca‘pi-
tal, to elevate the farmer class again, and to restrain undue luxury and
vice in the citieS. If he had been ambitious to conquer the world, he
was still more ambitious to govern it well.

But his ambition displeased men who perhaps mistook jealousy for
' patriotism, and wh0, at any rate, allowed themselves to be used as the
tools of Caesar's deadly enemies. They knew that he could crush all fair
