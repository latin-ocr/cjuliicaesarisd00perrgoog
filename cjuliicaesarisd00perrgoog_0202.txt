25-28. The tower is begun under cover of plutei and vineae 54
(29), and when its walls have been built up to the proper place for the
first ssoor (ad contabulationem), the beams of this fioor are imbedded
in the brick walls so as not to project beyond
the outer layer (extrema . . . structura).—ubi . . .
adhaeresceret: here and in l. 36 ubi = ut ibi,
where. Elsewhere in the chap. it means when.

28—p. 55, 11. Above this floor (contignationem
= contabulationem) they carry the brick walls
up as sar as the men can work under the plutei
and vineae, and then construet what is finally
to be ‘the roos of the tower as follows ε on the Εἴθ’· Ῑ·
walls thus tar built (supra eum locum), the lay
duo tigna transversa (Fig. 1), to serve as sup-
port (quibus suspenderent) for the skeleton
treme-work 01 the roos (Fig. 2), and over this
skeleton frume-work they put cross-pieces at right
angles with each other, and fasten them down
with planks (axibus) so as to project over the
wells os the tower on ,the three sides exposed to
the enemy (Fig. 3), so that protections against
missiles can hang down from these projections ¹

11-24. At last the plutei and vineae, under which the work

takes their place as 8 protection, is raised up with levers (pressionibus)
by itsels (per se ipsum) as high as the width of its rope-curtains,
from the walls on which it had been testing. Then the walls are built
up to it, under cover of the rope-curtainS. By raising the movable
roos with 8 second leverage (alia pressione) they make space for them-
selves to build the walls still higher, and so on until it is time to put
in 8 second flooring (alterius contabulationis), which they make like
